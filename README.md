This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript error related to type mismatch when handling events from Loader objects.  The original code incorrectly assumes that event.target will always be a Loader, leading to potential runtime errors. The solution provides a safer approach using type checking before accessing Loader-specific properties. This is crucial for robust ActionScript applications.
